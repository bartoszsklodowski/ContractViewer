## Demo

See the current build live by launching the main branch on a free Heroku instance. You will need a Free Heroku account if you havent already got an active account.

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://www.heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/bartoszsklodowski/ContractViewer)

Login details user: `User_1`/`Useruser123`
Login details admin: `admin`/`Adminadmin123`

## Setup

What are the project requirements/dependencies? Where are they listed? A requirements.txt or a Pipfile.lock file perhaps? Where is it located?

Proceed to describe how to install / setup one's local environment / get started with the project.

#### The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/bartoszsklodowski/ContractViewer.git
$ cd ContractViewer
```

#### Create a virtual environment to install dependencies in and activate it:

```sh
$ virtualenv2 --no-site-packages env
$ source env/bin/activate
```

#### Then install the dependencies:

```sh
(env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note the `(env)` in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal
session operates in a virtual environment set up by `virtualenv2`.

#### Migrate database

`python manage.py migrate`


#### Create superuser

Create a local admin user by entering the following command:

`python manage.py createsuperuser`

#### Create PostgreSQL database

Create a local postgres database using this tutorial and then change local_settings to put your database credentials.

[_Create database_](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-create-database/)

#### Start the app

`python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000 --settings=ContractViewer.local_settings`

#### Add initial data

You can add initial data either by going to the url the app is running on locally and adding `/admin` to the url.

Add some categories and you should be all set.

Or by entering 

`python manage.py loaddata fixtures.json`

## Tests

To run the tests, `cd` into the directory where `manage.py` is:
```sh
(env)$ python pytest
```

## Deploy with Docker

### Prerequisites:

- Docker - version 20.10

Windows hosts must use Education or more advanced versions to run Docker \
Download: https://innsida.ntnu.no/wiki/-/wiki/English/Microsoft+Windows+10

### Install:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/bartoszsklodowski/ContractViewer.git
$ cd ContractViewer
```

### Change DATABASES settings:

Go into `ContractViewer/settings` and uncomment settings for Docker and comment settings for Heroku.

### Run:

```sh
$ docker-compose up --build
```
Hosts the application on http://localhost:8000 with default settings

### Test reset password:

If you want to check reset password function you must go into Docker container:
```sh
$ docker exec -it contract_viewer /bin/bash
```

And start email DebuggingServer:
```sh
$ python -u -m smtpd -n -c DebuggingServer localhost:1025
```
You will receive you reset password link in the terminal.
